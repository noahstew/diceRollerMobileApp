# diceRollerMobileApp

This is a mobile app following "Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide [2023 Edition]" customized to my desired UI.

It was created in flutter and is a simple dice rolling app to which the user will push the "roll the die" buttton and a new random dice roll will generate onto the screen.

The customized UI seperated from the course includes different colours and gradients in the backdrop.
